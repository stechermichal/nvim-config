 # keymaps, other non-stock behavior

- Use C + <directional key> instead of CR + W + <directional key> to change windows.
- Space as leader
- Leader + e = left hand explore at size 30
- <> in visual mode to indent
- alt + j/k in visual mode to move selected up 
- C + Arrows = resize window
- Shift + L/H to jump between buffers
- typing j k in insert mode puts you into normal mode 
- Hold onto what has been yanked after pasting, instead of whatever was pasted over overwriting the yank
